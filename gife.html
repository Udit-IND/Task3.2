            <ol>
                <li>Raksha Bandhan is also known nationwide as "Rakhi Poornima", or "Rakhi", or "Rakhri". Most people like to say Raksha Bandhan.</li>
                <li>The thread that the sister ties on her brother's wrist are very auspicious. The thread denotes the 'Bandhan' part in Raksha Bandhan. It stands for a two-part bond and is a symbol of protection or 'Raksha', which the younger sister wants from her brother.</li>
                <li>Rakshabandhan falls on the last day of Shravan, so the devotees pay their respects to Lord Vishnu by praying at sea, keeping in mind the 'Nariyal' or coconut. Since Maharashtra is a coastal region, Raksha Bandhan day is also known as Naryal Purnima day there. They have their own customs, which the people of Maharashtra follow in their own way.</li>
                <li> Very few people know the full story behind this fact. According to this legend, Lord Krishna once cut off his hand while flying a kite. Seeing this, Draupadi immediately tore a piece of cloth from her sari and tied it to Krishna. In return, Lord Krishna promised to protect Draupadi under any circumstances. Later, Lord Krishna protected Draupadi during her Cheer Haran.</li>
                <li> Nobel prize winner Rabindranath Tagore used the festival Raksha Bandhan to maintain peace and harmony between Hindus and the Muslim community during 1905, Partition of Bengal.</li>
