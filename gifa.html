                <li>There are 206 countries in the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which means Team USA athletes wonâ€™t be the only competitors vying for their place in the history books.</li>
                <li>There are 72 countries that have never earned an Olympic medal. Some of the larger, more notable countries never to medal include Bolivia, Cambodia, Honduras, Nepal and Yemen.</li>
                <li>A total of 11,091 athletes are expected to compete in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Those 11,091 athletes will compete in 41 different sports and 339 events this summer at the Olympics.</li>
                <li>France will play host for a sixth time in 2024 but it will still be chasing the United States as the country that has hosted the most Olympics. The United States has hosted the Olympics eight times. Team USA will once again be playing on its home turf when the games return stateside with the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.</li>
